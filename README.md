# CentOS Packer Build Project

Contains files to automatically build CentOS virtual machines. Currently supports CentOS 7 and VirtualBox.

Run `setup.py` with Python 2 to download Packer, then run `bin/packer build centos7.json` to build the virtual machine.

Windows support is experimental and 'best effort'.
